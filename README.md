#How to Run
This was done in Google Colab

Run the Clean.ipynb file first to clean the audio and store them in your drive in the right locations. 

Next, Run the Seperation Moss+Strat.ipynb file to seperate the audio. Check the paths to make sure everything is correct. 

Look at visualizations and listen to results to check success and performance. Read my documented approach here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Gf_Am9_mbLGb_6pU4k5W8aXivyETiJy5yYzAO3mOu8/edit?usp=sharing
